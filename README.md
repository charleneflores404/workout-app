## Description

This is a workout app that allows users to log their workouts (type, load, and reps), with user authentication.

Currently expanding the app from [NetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja)'s Youtube [tutorial playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE&si=92I_asgiB331knF0) for MERN Stack.

## Work in Progress

The app is still evolving! I'm planning to add more functionalities and improvements in future updates, including statistics to track progress as well as a redesign of the layout.
